`elife-validator-ui` provides a user interface for choosing a JATS XML file to be validated with the [`jats-validator-docker`](https://github.com/JATS4R/jats-validator-docker) web service, and for viewing the validation results alongside the input XML.

The app is built for static deployment with `now build` and can be run locally for development with `now dev`.
